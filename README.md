# installtest

This is a simple package that doesn't do anything else but check whether you have all the tools necessary for the introduction to writing packages with R and github. 

It contains a single function, `has_all_tools()`, which checks whether you have the necessary packages installed. It also serves as a first example of how a package can look like.
